# Cosmic Coffee Roasters

Theme
-----

Cosmic Coffee Roasters is a small static website for a specialty coffee shop. The design focuses on warm imagery, clear navigation, and simple responsive layouts to showcase the brand, services, and contact information.

File organization
-----------------

- `index.html` — Home / landing page with hero and highlights.
- `about.html` — Brand story and shop information.
- `services.html` — List of offerings and any service details.
- `contact.html` — Contact form or contact details for the shop.
- `Assets/` — Images used across the site (coffee photos, interior shots).

Challenges faced
----------------

- Image sizing and responsive layout: ensuring images scale nicely across screen sizes without layout shift.
- Consistent styling across pages with a simple CSS approach (avoiding large frameworks for this assignment).
- File path management while developing from OneDrive to avoid accidental sync conflicts.

Notes
-----

This is a lightweight static site suitable for hosting on GitHub Pages or any static host. Open `index.html` locally to preview.
